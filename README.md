# D2D

Drop 2 Drop is a dream for gathering all the water sources in the world for doing available to all users

It is interesting for both, people traveling on the hotest cities of Spain or trekers crossing the Alps

Project had been developed by Ferran Bals and myself as a set of connectors able to collect data from Open Data sources from city councils and governments. At the actual status of the project is able to read from CSV's files and insert it on a structure table (scripts included on the project)

It has been developed using TDD techniques, so, on the Junit files we are updating real sources of data

Nexts steps
* Connector to API's (French cities had an unified system of information)
* Migration to NoSQL sources

Do you want to join on this trip? We would like to have a web version and improve the data sets. On the future a mobile app for checking fountains and addign new information and comments will be availabel.
